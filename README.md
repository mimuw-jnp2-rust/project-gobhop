# GobHop

## Description
GobHop is a platformer game where the player controls a goblin in a vertical tunnel. The goal is to make it as high as possible by jumping on platforms and using rockets to launch the goblin further. If the goblin falls, the game ends.

## Features
- controls, including walking left and right on a platform, regular jump and rocket jump (higher than regular, but consumes a container of rocket fuel)
- randomly generated platforms and rocket fuel containers
- score based on how high you managed to get
- combo score multipliers for advancing many floors in a quick succession
- high scores screen

## Plan
First I'd like to create the base functionalities of the game. This includes the controls and platform generation. At this point the graphics may still be placeholders.

Then, I'd like to add the remaining features, which include scores, combos, recording high scores and possibly some additional ones (such as different platform types, powerups and local multiplayer), depending on how the game feels to play.
